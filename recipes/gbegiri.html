    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gbegiri is a delicious, slightly watery soup made from pureed beans. It is a signature soup of the Yoruba people of Nigeria, often combined with Ewedu soup and a tomato-based stew to form the popular trio known as 'Abula'.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Beans:</strong> 2 cups of dried beans (Black-eyed beans or brown/honey beans are ideal), peeled.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning:</strong> 1 cooking spoon of Red Palm Oil (for color and flavor).</li>
        <li>Aromatics/Spices:
            <ul>
                <li>1 - 2 tablespoons of Ground Crayfish.</li>
                <li>1 - 2 teaspoons of Ground Dried Pepper (or to taste).</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon of Locust Beans (Iru/Dawadawa), optional but highly recommended.</li>
                <li>2-3 Seasoning Cubes (Knorr, Maggi, etc.).</li>
                <li>Salt to taste.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Water.</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <ol>Step 1: Peel and Cook the Beans
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Peel the Beans:</strong> Soak the dried beans in water for about 30 minutes to 1 hour to loosen the skin. Rub the beans between your palms (or pulse briefly in a blender) to remove the peels. Wash repeatedly until the beans are completely peeled.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Beans:</strong> Place the peeled beans in a pot. Add enough water to cover them (about 2 cups, adding more as needed).</li>
                <li><strong>Boil:</strong> Cook the beans on medium-high heat until they are very soft and mushy. This may take up to an hour depending on the bean type. Do not add salt at this stage, as it can slow the cooking process.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 2: Puree the Beans
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cool Slightly:</strong> Allow the cooked beans to cool down a little before blending (especially if your blender jug is plastic).</li>
                <li><strong>Blend:</strong> Transfer the soft, mushy beans (and the cooking water/stock) into a blender. Blend until you have a completely <strong>smooth, silky puree.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><em>Traditional Method:</em></strong> Use an <strong>'Ijabe'</strong> (a small cooking broom) to vigorously whisk the soft beans until smooth, then pass it through a sieve.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><strong>Sieve (Optional but Recommended):</strong> To ensure a perfectly smooth, silky consistency, pass the blended bean puree through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean pot. Discard any remaining chaff.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 3: Finish the Soup
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Place the smooth bean puree back on the stove over low heat. The consistency should be semi-fluid; add a little water if it is too thick.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Palm Oil:</strong> Stir in the red palm oil. This should turn the color from white/cream to a light yellow-orange.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Seasoning:</strong> Add the ground crayfish, locust beans (iru), ground pepper, and seasoning cubes.</li>
                <li><strong>Stir and Cook:</strong> Stir all the ingredients thoroughly until well combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Simmer:</strong> Allow the soup to cook for 5 to 7 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li><strong>Taste and Adjust:</strong> Taste the soup and add salt as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> The Gbegiri soup is ready when the palm oil is well-blended, and the soup has slightly thickened (it will continue to thicken as it cools).</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <p><strong><em>Gbegiri is best served hot with <strong>Amala</strong>, along with <strong>Ewedu Soup</strong> and a flavorful<strong>Buka Stew (Omi Obe)</strong>.</em></strong></p>
    </ul>
