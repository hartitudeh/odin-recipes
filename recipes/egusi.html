    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Made recipe exactly as written. This was a scrumptious, rich and hearty meal. Garnished with sour cream and flat leaf parsley.</p>

    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Assorted meats (beef, goat meat, cow skin/kpomo, tripe/shaki), stockfish, and smoked/dried fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Egusi:</strong> Ground melon seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Red palm oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Pepper Mix:</strong> Blended mix of fresh pepper (e.g., scotch bonnet/atarodo, bell pepper/tatashe) and onion.</li>
        <li><strong>Aromatics/Seasoning:</strong> Chopped onion, ground crayfish, locust beans (iru/ogiri, optional), seasoning cubes, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Chopped leafy greens like fluted pumpkin leaves (ugu), spinach, or bitter leaf.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquid:</strong> Meat/fish stock (broth) or water.</li>
    </ul>
     <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <ol>Step 1: Prepare the Meat and Stock
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cook Protein:</strong> Place your assorted meats (beef, goat meat, cow skin, etc.) in a pot. Add sliced onion, seasoning cubes, and salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Liquid:</strong> Pour in enough water to cook the meat and create a rich stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil:</strong> Cook until the meat is tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Reserve:</strong> Remove the cooked meat and fish from the pot, but <strong>keep the stock (broth).</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 2: Prepare the Egusi Paste and Pepper Base
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Egusi Paste:</strong> In a bowl, mix the ground egusi seeds with a little chopped onion and a small amount of warm water or stock to form a <strong>thick, stiff paste.</strong> (This helps create the characteristic lumps when fried).</li>
                <li><strong>Boil Pepper (Optional):</strong> If your blended pepper mix is too watery, you can boil it in a separate pot to evaporate some of the liquid.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 3: Fry the Egusi
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heat Oil:</strong> Place a clean pot over medium heat and add the palm oil. Allow it to heat for about 2-3 minutes until it's melted and hot (but <strong>do not bleach</strong> it).</li>
                <li><strong>Add Paste:</strong> Scoop the thick egusi paste into the hot palm oil. <strong>Do not stir immediately.</strong> Allow it to fry undisturbed for about 3-5 minutes so it begins to set and form lumps.</li>
                <li><strong>Fry and Stir:</strong> Begin to gently stir and break up the egusi as it fries. Continue to stir-fry for about 5-10 minutes until the egusi looks clumpy, slightly toasted, and its color has changed.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 4: Build the Soup
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Pepper and Aromatics:</strong> Pour the blended pepper mix, ground crayfish, and locust beans (if using) into the pot with the fried egusi. Stir well.</li>
                <li><strong>Simmer:</strong> Let it simmer for about 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Stock:</strong> Pour the reserved meat stock into the pot. Stir to combine. If the soup is too thick, add more water or stock until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Protein:</strong> Return the cooked meat, stockfish, and smoked fish to the soup.</li>
                <li><strong>Season:</strong> Add seasoning cubes and salt to taste. Allow the soup to simmer for another 10-15 minutes, letting the flavors meld.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 5: Add Vegetables and Final Simmer
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Greens:</strong> Stir in the chopped leafy greens (ugu, spinach, or bitter leaf). Cook for an additional 5 minutes until the greens are wilted and tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Taste:</strong> Taste the soup and adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from heat and serve hot with your choice of swallow (fufu, pounded yam, eba, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p><strong><em>Egusi Soup is traditionally served hot with a "swallow" like Pounded Yam, Garri (Eba), Semolina, or Fufu.</em></strong></p>
    </ul>
