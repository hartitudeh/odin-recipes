    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Okro (or Okra) Soup is one of the quickest and easiest Nigerian soups to prepare, known for its distinct "draw" or slimy, viscous texture. This method is often called "Ila Alasepo" (Okra cooked together).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Okra:</strong> Fresh okra, either chopped/sliced finely, grated, or lightly blended (a combination is often used for maximum 'draw').</li>
        <li><strong>Protein:</strong> Assorted meats (beef, tripe/shaki, cow skin/kpomo, etc.), stockfish, and smoked/dried fish. Fresh seafood (prawns/shrimp, crab) is optional but adds great flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Liquid/Fat:</strong> Red palm oil and meat/fish stock (broth).</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning/Aromatics:</strong> Ground crayfish, locust beans (iru/ogiri, optional), pepper (scotch bonnet/atarodo, blended or chopped), onion (chopped), seasoning cubes, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables (Optional):</strong> Chopped leafy greens like fluted pumpkin leaves (ugu) or spinach.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <ol>Step 1: Prepare the Meat and Stock
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Boil Meat:</strong> Place your toughest meats (like shaki/tripe and stockfish) in a pot. Add chopped onion, seasoning cubes, and salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Water:</strong> Pour in enough water to cover the meat and cook until they are slightly tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Softer Proteins:</strong> Add beef, cow skin, and dried/smoked fish (ensure dried fish is washed well first). Continue to cook until all the proteins are tender.</li>
                <li><strong>Reserve:</strong> Remove the cooked meats and fish from the pot, leaving the rich stock (broth) in the pot. If using fresh fish or shrimp, you can steam them briefly in the stock and remove them to avoid breaking.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 2: Prepare the Okra 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wash Okra:</strong> Wash the fresh okra and trim the ends.</li>
                <li><strong>Chop/Blend:</strong> Chop, grate, or lightly pulse the okra in a food processor until it reaches your desired consistency.
                <ul>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>For maximum "draw," use a combination of finely chopped and grated/blended okra.</em></li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 3: Cook the Soup Base
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Palm Oil:</strong> Into the pot containing the meat stock, pour the palm oil.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Seasoning:</strong> Add ground crayfish, locust beans (iru), and blended or chopped pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Boil:</strong> Bring the mix to a rolling boil for about 5-8 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and extra seasoning cubes if needed.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 4: Cook the Okra
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Okra:</strong> Pour the prepared okra (both blended and chopped, if using a mix) into the boiling soup base.</li>
                <li><strong>Stir:</strong> Stir vigorously to combine. This action helps "activate" the okra's sliminess (the "draw").</li>
                <li><strong>Cook Briefly:</strong> Let it simmer for only <strong>3 to 5 minutes.</strong> It is crucial not to overcook the okra, as it can reduce the sliminess and cause the color to dull.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Proteins:</strong> Gently return the cooked meats, stockfish, and fresh seafood (shrimps/fresh fish) to the pot.</li>
                <li><strong>Stir Gently:</strong> Stir very gently to combine the proteins without breaking the fish.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>Step 5: Finish with Greens (Optional)
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Add Leafy Greens:</strong> If using, stir in your chopped ugu (pumpkin leaves) or spinach.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Simmer:</strong> Cook for just 1-2 minutes until the leaves are wilted.</li>
                <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Turn off the heat immediately.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
